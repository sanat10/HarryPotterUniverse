# HarryPotterUniverse

I created this project using HTML, CSS , Javascript And BootStrap. It has 4 webpages.

# First Webpage:

The first webpage welcomes the user and lets him/her input their name and submit. For Example - Mudassir
If name is not submitted you get an alert prompting to submit.

# Second Webpage:
Lets click on Get Started wgich will take us to the second webpage.
This webpage lets us get sorted into one of the four Hogwart's houses.
Note that we get a congratulation message once we select the house.

# Third webpage:
The Third webpage lists famous wizards and witches who studied or were part of Hogwarts groups by houses in the form of a table.

# Fourth webpage:
This webpage provides the users with an amazon link to purchase Harry Potter Merchandise. Clicking on it will take us to the amazon website where the users can make the purchase.

That's it , I want to thank Sir David Malan who helped me achieve this.
